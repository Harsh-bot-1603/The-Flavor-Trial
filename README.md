# The-Flavor-Trial
Welcome to The Flavor Trail, an interactive web project designed to be your culinary guide through India, with a special focus on the vibrant food scene of Kolkata. This project combines a captivating 3D slideshow with a dynamic content carousel to provide a unique and immersive user experience.

# How It Works
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a seamless and interactive experience.

3D Image Slideshow: On the right side of the screen, a 3D image carousel rotates automatically, showcasing six different cuisines.

User Interaction: When you hover over the slideshow, the rotation pauses, allowing you to select an image. Clicking on a specific cuisine's image triggers a change in the main content area.

Dynamic Content Carousel: The main carousel on the left dynamically updates to display detailed information about the selected cuisine. Each content slide provides a curated guide to a specific type of cuisine, including a recommended restaurant in Kolkata, pricing information, operating hours, and a list of popular dishes.

Pop-up Image Feature: Clicking on an image in the 3D slideshow also triggers a small pop-up window, showing a larger view of the selected image. This pop-up can be closed by clicking a "close" button.

# Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file that provides the structure for the entire website, including the navigation, the slideshow, and the content carousel.

style.css: This file handles all the styling and visual effects, including the 3D transforms, animations, and the responsive layout. It uses relative units like vw and vh to ensure the design scales across different screen sizes.

script.js: This JavaScript file adds the interactivity. It listens for clicks on the slideshow images, manages the "active" state of the carousel items, and controls the display of the pop-up image.

# Key Features
Interactive Design: The site's core feature is the connection between the 3D slideshow and the main content area, creating a highly engaging user flow.

Responsive Layout: The use of relative CSS units ensures that the website looks and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Curated Content: The project provides a carefully selected list of authentic restaurants and popular street food spots in Kolkata, complete with practical details.

# How to Run
To run this project, simply download the files and open the index.html file in any modern web browser. All the necessary CSS and JavaScript files are linked locally.
